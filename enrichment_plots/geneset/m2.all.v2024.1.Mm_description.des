Pathway enrichment using the top genes in metagene_19 (table S5) showed regulation of the inflammatory response and myeloid cell differentiation. Top-ranked genes in this metagene include Trim12a and Trim5, which encode ubiquitin E3 ligases involved in autophagy"
ZENG_GU_ICB_CONTROL_METAGENE_21_PRECICTIVE_ICB_RESISTANCE	"Metagene derived from the control samples, found to be predictive of immune checkpoint blockade treatment resistance, not otherwise discussed."
ZENG_GU_ICB_CONTROL_METAGENE_25_PRECICTIVE_ICB_RESPONSE	"Metagene_25 is enriched in SKCM, which has a high response rate to anti-PD1 (Fig. 4D). The top-ranked genes in metagene_25 were Pdcd1, Cd8b1, and Cd3g (Fig. 5A), representative of CTL infiltration. Gene set enrichment analysis of genes in metagene_25 identified pathways of immunoregulatory interactions and antigen processing and presentation (Fig. 5, B and C). Metagene_25 also shows a positive correlation with improved patient survival and increased CD8+ T cell infiltration (Fig. 5, D and E)."
ZENG_GU_ICB_CONTROL_METAGENE_31_PRECICTIVE_ICB_RESISTANCE	"Metagene_31 is enriched in LIHC, which has a low response rate to ICB treatment (Fig. 4D). Metagene_31 is also highly enriched in the syngeneic mouse models that are resistant to ICB treatment (Fig. 2C). The top genes in metagene_31 include Col2a1, Col9a1/2, and Sox8 (Fig. 5F and table S5), and enriched pathways include extracellular matrix (ECM) receptor interactions and collagens (Fig. 5, G and H). Sox8 is a transcription factor involved in embryogenesis and is highly expressed in most hepatocellular carcinomas, where it has been shown to promote tumor cell proliferation (41). Tumor Immune Dysfunction and Exclusion (TIDE) (8) analysis suggested that Sox8 is highly expressed in alternatively activated M2 tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), which restrict intratumoral CTL infiltration. Col2a1 encodes the alpha-1 chain of type II collagen, a component of the ECM. Collagen induction has also been reported to confer immune evasion by physically impeding CTL infiltration (42). Moreover, metagene_31 level was positively correlated with the gene signature of alternatively activated M2 TAMs (Fig. 5I), which suppress CTL response (43)."
